# Margin Perceptron, Gaussian Kernel Perceptron, Polynomial Kernel Perceptron


# HOW TO USE
1. Run ```python main.py```
2. There are three types of perceptrons (can choose different methods for cross-checking):
   1. Margin Perceptron
    2. Gaussian Kernel Perceptron
    3. Polynomial kernel Perceptron
    

#### ps. train_set_0.txt and test_set_1.txt are default chosen data. 

## Multiple data sets
> 1. train_set_0.txt & test_set_0.txt (with 20000 training points, 10000 testing points)
> 2. train_set_1.txt & test_set_1.txt
> 3. train_set_2.txt & test_set_2.txt
> 4. train_set_3.txt & test_set_3.txt (with 20000 training points, 4000 testing points)
